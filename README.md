# Advanced Computer Programming Individual Project

## Sudoku

A customizable grid size puzzle where the user tries to find all missing squares. 

## Running the Program
To be able to run the program properly, users need to install and set up JAVAFX. It can be found here: https://openjfx.io/, as this will allow all the graphics used for the program to run properly. Additionally, once you create and load the project, you need to enable Java Tests, as it is also part of the modules required to run the program.
